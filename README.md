ChemicalCraft

This is going to be my upcoming mod for Minecraft which is called ChemicalCraft.
It uses Minecraft Forge so you're going to need that to run my mod. It's found on minecraftforge.net as well as some
good tutorials how to install it.

My mod also needs some sort of Electricity Api and the only one currently supported is Industerial Craft. It's found on
industerial-craft.net. Integration of the Universial Electricity Api is planned and I'll start with it as soon as I
finished the very basics of my mod.
